            <div class="card-content">
            <p>There are many ways of installing materialize and using it. They way I did it is linking materialize
                using CDN links. This is the easiest options as you just have to include and link the appropaite links.
                You are also able to download the materialize files and link the appropiate css and javascript sheets.

                <h1>How I built the page</h1>
            </div>
            <div  class="card-content">
            <p>Materialize has many easy-to-implement actions/components to help build your site.
               One of the first components I used was their custom colors. To use their custom colors,
               you simply have to add the color as a class fot the html element. I then used materialized
               card option to build my own custom cards for content. The card option has a card container, then you build a 
               card title div and a card-content div There are also card-image which allows you to add a image to a card. Materilaize also has its own custom icons that are aeasy to use, I used them for on a button 
               then added a btn-floating pulse class to it so that it flashes. I also used many other options like hover class for the header to
               have a unique animation when hovered over, align classes which helps align the content which ever way you want, text options like flox-text which helps the 
               text flow better.

                <p>There isnt much Difficulties when using materialize, except for the amount of options and components you can choose from.
                    The hardest part for me however was understanding the "Card" classes and thir structure. With these classses you can easily create
                    cards on your page with content in seconds however you will have to understand how to sturcute each card class properly
                    so that the card is built correctly.
